"""
Process a set of tweets copied (in HTML) from hootsuite.

This file reads from STDIN a copy-and-pasted file extracted from hootsuite.
Because hootsuite's format has changed over time, earlier versions of this
script would have produced slightly differently formatted output.

This script reverses the order of the lines, so the earliest tweets
come first. It also removes any duplicated lines (the result of RTs)

It prints the result on STDOUT.

Suggested usage: cat twitter_transcript_2013-04-02.html | ./process_hootsuite.py > twitter_transcript_2013-04-02rev.html

I still recommend you check the output to look for any errors in the
conversion process (particularly with character encodings), or manually 
delete irrelevant tweets.
